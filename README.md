# React Native In The Wild
## Abstract
You've worked through the tutorials, built a ToDo app, made peace with JSX, and fallen in love with HMR - now you are facing the chasm between what is known and what needs to be built. You want to build a smooth, intuitive interface that engages the user. The app needs to seamlessly connect to multiple APIs, handle large datasets, and deftly deal with the loss of connection. How do you make the leap from demo code to a real world, complex cross platform mobile app?

This talk will vault you over the gap. Through real world code examples, you will learn to unravel NPM, access APIs, tame Redux, navigate navigation, and grapple gargantuan datasets. You will also dive into testing, discover local database tools, and conquer disconnection. Come make the jump to building react native apps in the wild.

I like this one, but it seems like a companion to the precompiler.  So, two questions:  
* Is that okay?  Can you actually prep that much material?  
* Is it worth tying them together in the submission?  Seems like it would be.
